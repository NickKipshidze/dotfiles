This is my daily driver. I found waybar configuration on r/unixporn and modified it.
For waybar icons make sure you have `otf-hermit-nerd` installed:

```shell
$ sudo pacman -S otf-hermit-nerd
```

## Vim

I have vim plugins in my .vim directory I didnt upload the .vim directory becuase I didnt want to add someone else's repos in my dotfiles. You can get the plugins yourself:

- vim-code-dark
- AutoComplPop
- nerdtree
- vim-devicons
- vim-eclim
- vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight
- vim-visual-multi
